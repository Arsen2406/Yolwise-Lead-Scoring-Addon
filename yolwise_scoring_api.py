# ⚠️ DEPRECATED FILE ⚠️
# 
# This file has been CONSOLIDATED into main.py following Flask best practices
# and Context7 MCP Server analysis for single-file applications.
#
# 🚀 USE main.py INSTEAD
#
# All functionality has been moved to main.py for:
# - Better Replit deployment
# - Simpler maintenance  
# - Flask best practices compliance
# - No import path issues
#
# This file will be removed in the next cleanup.
